# Salmon Watersheds Program

The [Pacific Salmon Foundation](www.psf.ca)â€™s [Salmon Watersheds Program](www.salmonwatersheds.ca) is working to help foster healthy, diverse and abundant wild salmon populations throughout British Columbia.

The Salmon Watersheds Program works to strengthen the baseline of scientific information available for wild Pacific salmon populations and their habitats. We strive to make this information broadly accessible to federal, provincial and First Nations governments, industry, environmental stewards, and others that have an interest in the conservation and long-term sustainability of Pacific salmon and the watersheds that support them.

**As part of our work to democratize salmon-related data, we are increasing efforts to make our data compilation and analyses transparent and reproducible.** Please be patient as we work to upload existing repositories and code to this organization GitHub page, and check back often to see where we're at! 

For more information about the Salmon Watersheds Program and our work, visit [our website](www.salmonwatersheds.ca) or check out our flagship data visualization tool, the [Pacific Salmon Explorer](www.salmonexplorer.ca).
